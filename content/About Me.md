# About Me

I'm a geek and software engineer with extensive experience that could be helpful to others. Throughout the years, I've been documenting my personal notes in Markdown format, and now I've decided to share some of them with the public.

Instead of creating a traditional blog, I prefer a Digital Garden style for my notes. They may not always have a formal or structured appearance. I don't want to spend a lot of time finalizing lengthy articles. Instead, I want to share clean and adequately structured notes. Hope it will be useful for you!
